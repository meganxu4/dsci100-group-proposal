    "Red wine is a popular type of wine made from dark-colored grapes, known for its rich flavor and complexity. Wine quality is typically evaluated based on factors such as aroma, taste, and acidity, etc. We use this dataset to address: “how can a business predict the quality of wine they produce based on its chemical composition by using this dataset?”\n",

    "### Choosing Predictor Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Figure 1, we created a series of correlation graphs with each variable in the original data set. We observed how each variable had an impact on the classification of the quality of the wine, where ranges shaded red were classified as “bad” wine, ranges shaded blue were classified as “excellent” wine, and regions shaded green were classified as “good” wine. From here we analyzed which variables provided distinct groupings based on quality, to see which columns would be good predictor variables and train the classifier to be more accurate. From the analysis described above, we chose to use the columns we will use when classifying will be Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Sulphates, and Alcohol as predictor variables and Quality as the response variable. Based on the distribution of 1-10 quality, we will categorize quality as a factor between \"bad\", \"moderate\", and \"good\".\n"

    "## Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we found that our final classifier model gives an accuracy of around 95% when testing the model on the test data. \n",
    "In k-nearest neighbors algorithm, the number of neighbors is an important hyperparameter that determines the number of nearest neighboring samples used for prediction. When setting the optimal number of neighbors to 1, the model will only consider a single nearest neighbor sample for prediction. In such case, the model may become overly sensitive to the training data and overly complex, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if upsample technique is used in the training data, it means that samples from the minority class are duplicated or generated to increase their weight during the training process. This may cause the model to overfit the minority class in the training data, resulting in decreased generalization performance on the test data or unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, setting the optimal number of neighbors to 1 while using upsample technique may result in good performance on the training data but poor performance on the test data or unseen data, indicating overfitting. To mitigate this issue, one can try adjusting the number of neighbors or using other model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation to select appropriate hyperparameter settings and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact of our findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our current findings, businesses can use our model to test the quality (i.e. good, moderate, or bad) of a new wine. In the future, people who want to test the wine quality can also use our model to test how accurate the estimation of the quality of their wine is. In this case, people can try to test their wine quality with a higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From our analysis, some future application questions that we might consider would be:\n",
    "“How can the results of this study affect wine manufacturing processes to ensure higher quality?”\n",
    "“How can the results of this analysis affect pricing strategies for wine?”\n",
