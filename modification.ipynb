    "# Red Wine Quality Classifier\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Red wine is a popular type of wine made from dark-colored grapes, known for its rich flavor and complexity. Wine quality is typically evaluated based on factors such as aroma, taste, and acidity,etc. We use this dataset to address “how can a business predict the quality of wine they produce based on its chemical composition by using this dataset”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 12 input variables in this dataset based on physicochemical tests: \n",
    "\n",
    "        1 - fixed acidity ((grams of tartaric acid)/dm3): refers to the non-volatile acids present in wine, which do not evaporate easily.\n",
    "        2 - volatile acidity ((grams of acetic acid)/dm3): refers to the amount of acetic acid in wine, which can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste if present in excessive amounts.       \n",
    "        3 - citric acid (g/dm3): is found in small quantities in wine and can add a sense of freshness and flavor to it.\n",
    "        4 - residual sugar (g/dm3): refers to the amount of sugar left over after the fermentation process is complete,wines with more than 45 grams per liter are considered sweet. \n",
    "        5 - chlorides(In grams of sodium chloride per cubic decimetre): refer to the amount of salt present in wine.       \n",
    "        6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm3): helps prevent microbial growth and wine oxidation. \n",
    "        7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm3): refers to the amount of both free and bound forms of SO2. Concentrations over 50 ppm can be detected in the taste and aroma of wine.\n",
    "        8 - density (g/cm3): Density of wine is close to that of water and depends on its alcohol and sugar content.\n",
    "        9 - pH :measures the acidity or basicity of wine on a scale from 0 to 14.\n",
    "        10 - sulphates ((grams of potassium sulphate)/dm3): are an additive in wine that can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas levels, acting as an antimicrobial and antioxidant. \n",
    "        11 - alcohol: percentage of alcohol content is an important factor to consider when assessing wine quality. \n",
    "        Output variable (based on sensory rating): \n",
    "        12 - quality (between 0-10): Sensory rating by human experts.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Methods:\n",
    "First split the dataset into training and dataset. Use training set to preprocess and create model specification. Next use cross-validation on training set to determine the best K nearest-neighbor value to use when creating a classifier, which ensures the highest prediction accuracy. Lastly, use the tuned classifier with K value that gives the highest prediction accuracy on the testing set to predict the quality of the newly introduced wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns we will use when classifying will be pH, alcohol, sulphates, residual sugar, volatile acidity, and quality. We chose to use these columns because these qualities will significantly ater the human assessed quality of a new wine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the result with a line plot that includes the different wines numbered 1 to n, where n is the total number of wines used (ordered, distinct numerical values), on the x-axis and their ratings from 0-10 on the y-axis (distinct numerical values). \n",
    "## Expected outcomes and significance:\n",
    "In this research, we expected to find which physicochemical properties make high-quality red wine, and what chemical compositions are required for high-quality red wine. Once we know what physicochemical properties contribute to a good quality score, businesses will be able to use this information to help them produce higher-quality wine. Based on our findings, we came up with two questions that can be worked on in the future:\n",
    "“What role does each chemical composition play in making high-quality red wine?”\n",
    "“What relationships between these properties contribute to making high-quality red wine?”\n",
